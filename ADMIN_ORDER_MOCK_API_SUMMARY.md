# Admin Service Payment Mock API Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Mock Data Structure
- **Updated `mockOrders`** in `src/services/mockData.js`:
  - Changed from order objects to medical service payment structure
  - Updated IDs from "ORD001" format to "PAY001" format to reflect payments
  - Added detailed patient and doctor information
  - Included payment details with medical testing services
  - Added status history tracking for each payment
  - Created 8 realistic service payments with various statuses

### 2. Updated Mock Data Fields
- **Payment Structure**:
  - `id`: String format (e.g., "PAY001") for payment identification
  - `designer`: Object with doctor/healthcare provider info
  - `customer`: Object with patient information  
  - `orderPrice`: Total payment amount for medical services
  - `date`: ISO timestamp of payment creation
  - `status`: Current payment status
  - `orderDetails`: Array of medical services with pricing and quantities
  - `statuses`: Array of payment status history with timestamps

### 3. Updated Service Layer
- **Enhanced `getOrdersById`** in `src/services/UsersSevices.js`:
  - Converted from real API call to mock implementation
  - Added 500ms delay to simulate network request
  - Added proper error handling for non-existent orders
  - Returns complete order details including order items and status history

### 4. Added Filter Functions
- **Created `filterOrdersBySearch`** in `src/services/mockData.js`:
  - Filters orders by order ID, customer name, or designer name
  - Case-insensitive search functionality

- **Created `filterOrdersByStatus`** in `src/services/mockData.js`:
  - Filters orders by status (Pending, Processing, Delivered, Refunded, Cancelled)

### 5. Updated Components
- **Updated `OrderTable.jsx`**:
  - Changed headers from "Đơn hàng" to "Thanh toán dịch vụ"
  - Updated column names (Nhà thiết kế → Bác sĩ, Người mua → Khách hàng)
  - Updated search placeholder to "Mã thanh toán"
  - Imported new filter functions
  - Replaced manual filtering logic with dedicated filter functions
  - Maintained existing UI and functionality

- **Updated `AdminOrder.jsx`**:
  - Changed page title from "Đơn hàng" to "Thanh toán dịch vụ"
  - Updated search placeholder to match payment context

- **Updated `AdminOrderDetail.jsx`**:
  - Changed page title to "Chi tiết thanh toán"
  - Updated labels (Nhà thiết kế → Bác sĩ, Tổng giá → Tổng tiền)
  - Changed "Danh sách sản phẩm" to "Danh sách dịch vụ"
  - Updated table headers to reflect medical services

### 6. Documentation
- **Updated `ADMIN_USER_MOCK_API.md`**:
  - Added comprehensive Payment object structure documentation
  - Updated terminology from orders to service payments
  - Added documentation for `getAllOrdersAPI` and `getOrdersById` functions
  - Added usage examples for payment-related APIs
  - Updated object descriptions to reflect medical service context
  - Included mock data characteristics and features

### 7. Testing
- **Created `mockOrderTest.js`**:
  - Test script for order mock APIs
  - Tests pagination, order details, and error scenarios
  - Validates API functionality

### 8. Service Exports
- **Updated exports** in `UsersSevices.js`:
  - Added `getOrdersById` to exported functions
  - Ensured all order-related functions are properly accessible

## Mock Data Characteristics

### Payment Statuses
- **Pending**: 1 payment (PAY005) 
- **Processing**: 2 payments (PAY002, PAY007)
- **Delivered**: 3 payments (PAY001, PAY003, PAY008)
- **Cancelled**: 1 payment (PAY004)
- **Refunded**: 1 payment (PAY006)

### Payment Value Range
- Minimum: 950,000 VND (PAY004)
- Maximum: 5,200,000 VND (PAY008)
- Average: ~2,800,000 VND

### Medical Services Included
- Various medical testing services and procedures
- Realistic pricing (80,000 - 1,300,000 VND per service)
- Different categories (blood tests, imaging, specialized procedures)
- Healthcare professional consultations and examinations

## API Endpoints Now Using Mock Data

### Service Payment Management
- `getAllOrdersAPI(pageNumber, pageSize)` - Get paginated service payments
- `getOrdersById(orderId)` - Get detailed payment information

### Dashboard (Previously Implemented)
- `getRevenueByDayAPI(month, year)` - Revenue by day
- `getTopDesignersByRevenueAPI(limit)` - Top designers
- `getOrderStatusByMonthAPI()` - Order status distribution
- `getCustomerGrowthAPI()` - Customer growth metrics
- `getTopProductsAPI()` - Top performing products

### User Management (Previously Implemented)
- `getAllAccountsAPI(role, pageNumber, pageSize)` - User accounts
- `getAwaitingDesignersAPI(pageNumber, pageSize)` - Pending designers
- `applicationResultAPI(email, isApproved)` - Designer approval

### Testing Services (Previously Implemented)
- `getAllFurnituresAPI(pageNumber, pageSize)` - Testing services
- `getAllFursByDesAPI(designerId, pageNumber, pageSize)` - Services by designer

## Integration Status

✅ **Completed**: Admin service payment functionality now fully uses mock APIs
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing components continue to work unchanged
✅ **Consistent UX**: 500ms delay maintains realistic loading experience
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full payment lifecycle from creation to completion
✅ **Proper Documentation**: Complete API reference and usage examples
✅ **Medical Context**: Updated terminology and data to reflect healthcare services

## Next Steps

The admin service payment mock API implementation is complete and ready for use. The system now provides:
- Realistic medical service payment data for development and testing
- Complete payment management workflow simulation
- Consistent API patterns across all admin functions
- Comprehensive documentation for developers
- Proper healthcare terminology and context

All admin functionality (users, testing services, payments, dashboard) now operates on mock data, providing a complete development environment independent of backend services.
